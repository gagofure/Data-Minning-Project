# Text Mining and Analysis ReadMe

Welcome to my Text Mining and Analysis project! This R-based project aims to analyze and derive insights from textual data using various techniques such as text mining, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis.

## Data

The data is from Amozon Book Reviews dataset ```Amazon_Book_Reviews.csv```.

## Tasks

The task is divied inro 4 parts:

  1. Text Mining
  2. Sentiment Analysis
  3. Topic Modeling
  4. Network Analysis

## Task A: Text Mining

In Task A, we perform basic text mining operations such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming using R libraries such as `tm` and `textstem`. Text mining helps us extract valuable information and insights from unstructured textual data.

## Task B: Sentiment Analysis

Task B involves sentiment analysis, which aims to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. We use sentiment lexicons and machine learning models implemented in R packages like `sentimentr` and `textclassification` to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on the underlying sentiment.

## Task C: Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is the process of identifying topics or themes present in a collection of documents. In Task C, we employ techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using R packages like `topicmodels` and `ldatuning` to uncover latent topics within the textual data and explore their distributions across documents.

## Task D: Network Analysis

Network analysis involves studying the structure, relationships, and properties of networks or graphs derived from textual data. In Task D, we analyze networks of words, entities, or documents to uncover patterns, centralities, and communities within the data using R packages such as `igraph` and `tidygraph`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages listed in the project's `DESCRIPTION` file.
3. Run the R scripts to perform the analysis.
4. Explore the results and visualizations generated from each task.
